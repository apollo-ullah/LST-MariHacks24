Hey, welcome to Live Speech Translator!

Here's a brief overview of the app's functionality across devices:

## Desktop - Windows & MacOS
The app actively picks up on speech from the microphone, it converts it into text, translates it, and outputs the audio to the user in their desired language.
This means a user can click "start listening" and whatever they say will return the audio translation.

### Try out our app! https://lst-mari-hacks24.vercel.app/

## Mobile - Android & IOS Issues
For Android - The app will display translations, but it will only output audio for a few languages: english, french and spanish.

For IOS - Due to Apple's strict policy and guidelines, it is not possible to playback audio without a user directly requesting it, but it will still display translations.

## What's next for Live Speech Translator?
We truly believe our app can revolutionize the way that we communicate and help people come to an understanding in all aspects of society, whether that be surpassing language barriers in education, healthcare, business, travel, etc.

We seek to improve our application by tackling the challenges experienced for IOS and Android devices and make it more user-centric by adding languages, key functionalities and user-friendly in the near future!
