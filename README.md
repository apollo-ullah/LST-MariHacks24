Hey, welcome to Live Speech Translator, Here's a brief overview of its functionality.

## Desktop - Windows & MacOS
The app picks up on speech from the microphone, it converts it into text, translates it, and outputs the audio to the user in their desired language.

## Mobile - Android & IOS
There are a key issues with android and ios.
For Android, although our app can display the translated text, it is only capable of outputting audio for a few languages: english, french, spanish.
For IOS, it only displays translated text. Due to Apple's strict guidelines, it is not possible to playback audio without a user directly asking for it.

## What's next for Live Speech Translator?
Even with its current drawbacks, we truly believe our app can truly revolutionize communication and help people come to an understanding in all aspects of society, whether that be surpassing language barriers in education, healthcare, business, travel, etc. We seek to improve our application by tackling the challenges experienced for IOS and Android devices and make it more user-centric by adding languages, key functionalities and user-friendly in the near future!
